Task 03 (20 points)
Now weâ€™re going to add even more interactivity to your class. Building on what you have
so far, you will now add the following:
- overload the str() and len() methods to return useful information for your class
- overload the equivalence operator (==) such that its use with your class will compare
one of the variables and return true if they are the same and false otherwise

Example structure
__str__():
return name
__len__():
return size
__==__(otherdog):
if rate == otherdog.rate
    return True
else
return False
