“A security script?? What fools! No one may stop the mighty DOCTOR DOOM from
accessing the satellite broadcasting system. I’ll show those bumbling do-gooders that it
is DOOM who will be victorious. You will use what you have learned in this section in
order to create a script that will run the so called security script created by those
overzealous oafs and get access to the satellite broadcasting system. DESTROY THE
ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN DOOM AND COMPLETE POWER OVER ALL THE
WORLD’S SATELLITE BASED MEDIA BROADCASTING. Soon the whole world will hear
the message of DOOM!!!”
